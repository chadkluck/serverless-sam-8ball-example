# API Gateway is automatically created with just the function resource declared.
# Deploy as is and see how it works.
# Then, to see how things change when you declare the api gateway on your own, uncomment all the lines and re-build and re-deploy
# Note that the api sub domain will change (and will be listed in the Outputs section). This is because you discarded the default API and declared your own.
# You may uncomment _EVERYTHING_ below this line (and remove this comment block if you wish)
